# Project Z

Goal: Total remake of a topdown zombie-based shooter game I made back in my intro CS class, hopefully with better coding practices and better features (and in C# rather than Python).

If you want to see that original project, you can find it here: https://github.com/notbenwang/CS1110-Final-Project/

Remake is still heavily WIP but progress is looking good!
